	                    	If you visit a lot of websites, the graph's size might obstruct you from identifying desired patterns. Using filters, you can show only parts of the graph that you are interested in.

	                    	The application creates a separate node for each visited domain. You might need to observe an aggregated behaviour of several domains. For instance, you might need to cluster all sub-domains of a specific root domain into a single node, or you might even want to cluster domains from different organisations, such as Youtube with Google.

	                    	By default, only domain nodes are shown by the application. In order to make a more detailed investigation, you can expand all the resources of a domain and observe where each resource was requested from and what it requested as well.

	                    	Domain-specific metrics calculated for each node can assist characterisation of domains, such as potentially phishing domains, domains that are tracking you browsing activity or domains that are leaking a big part of your activity on them to other websites.
